Crud App is a Single Page Application whose main purpose is to show example of a blog. Blog pulls data from [this API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

Its created using React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, AJAX.

You can click every blog, edit or delete it.

console.logs are just for ensuring that app works correctly, in production all console logs will be removed and app will have a lot more friendly user interface with confirmations that data is sent or edited.

CSS properties are sorted alphabetically.

Please note that in completing this project was invested 3-4 hours and that project is done in its most basic form. For implementing more complex features as Redux, confirmation screens, optimizations, etc. it will require more time which at the moment as fully employed applicant I don't have. Thank you and looking forward to your review.
